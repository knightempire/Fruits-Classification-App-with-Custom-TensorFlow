# Image Classification App with Custom TensorFlow Model

This repository contains an image classification application that classifies fruits using a custom TensorFlow model. We have implemented and compared two models for this task: a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) and MobileNetV2.

## Model Performance

- **CNN Model Accuracy:** 92%
- **MobileNetV2 Model Accuracy:** 58%
